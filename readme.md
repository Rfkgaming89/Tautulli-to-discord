A quick and dirty Python script to display in discord what is being played along with media count from Tautulli 

Replace YOUR_TAUTULLI_API_KEY, YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN, and the channel IDs with your own values.

You will need to install the discord.py library if you haven't already done so, by running pip install discord.py.
